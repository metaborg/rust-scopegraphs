#![warn(missing_docs)]
//! Scope graphs are an abstraction that allow you to express the complicated
//! name resolution patterns that many programming languages have.
//! Put simply, a scope graph encodes what names are defined in which scopes of
//! a program, and how scopes relate to each other.
//! Then, we can run queries over this graph to create links from usages of names
//! to definitions of names.
//! However, to make name resolution flexible,
//! the building of the graph and the querying over the graph can happen concurrently:
//! we don't need an entire graph before we can start querying it.
//!
//! This library, and its documentation serve as both a kind of reference implementation of scope graphs,
//! a usable library for your programming language,
//! a tutorial of how to use scope graphs
//! and a tutorial of how you could implement scope graphs yourself.
//!
//! ## Research
//!
//! Scope graphs are based on research.
//! These are some papers that introduce the topic in a more scientific fashion than we will here.
//! That is on purpose: The documentation of this library are meant to be the more informal explanation of scope graphs.

/// Generates a struct implementing [`RegexMatcher`].
/// Instances of this struct can match the regular expression that is specified.
///
/// Syntax: `$attrs type $type<$alphabet_type> = regex`.
/// For example:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use std::borrow;
/// use scopegraphs::*;
///
/// pub enum Alphabet {
///     A,
///     B,
///     C,

///
/// # Query Directly
///
/// Instead of using [`compile_regex`], you can also use [`query_regex`], which has a simpler syntax
/// and can immediately be used to match a string. This is useful if you want to use a regular expression
/// only once.
/// ```
/// # use std::borrow;
/// # use scopegraphs::*;
/// #
/// # pub enum Alphabet {
/// #    A,
/// #    B,
/// #    C,

/// # use Alphabet::*;

/// with
/// ```grammar
/// $label_order: $( $label_group )<*
/// $label_group: { $($variant),* } | $variant
/// $variant: $ident | '$'

/// Here, `$` means the end-of-path label: i.e., the current scope.
///
/// Using `{ ... }`, labels with equal priority can be grouped.
///
/// Multiple partial orders can be combined using `,`-separators: `X < Y, Z < Y`.
///
/// Sequences of multiple `<` can be chained (`X < Y < Z`).
/// This is equivalent to the 2-windowed decomposition: `X < Y, Y < Z` (which, by transitivity, also includes `X < Z`).
///
/// The macro will at compile time validate whether the order is a strict partial order, and report
/// any symmetric or reflexive entries.
