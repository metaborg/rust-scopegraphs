//! Scope graphs are an abstraction that allow you to express the complicated
//! name resolution patterns that many programming languages have.
//! Put simply, a scope graph encodes what names are defined in which scopes of
//! a program, and how scopes relate to each other.
//! Then, we can run queries over this graph to create links from usages of names
//! to definitions of names.
//! However, to make name resolution flexible,
//! the building of the graph and the querying over the graph can happen concurrently:
//! we don't need an entire graph before we can start querying it.
//!
//! This library, and its documentation serve as both a kind of reference implementation of scope graphs,
//! a usable library for your programming language,
//! a tutorial of how to use scope graphs
//! and a tutorial of how you could implement scope graphs yourself.
//!
//! ## Research
//!
//! Scope graphs are based on research.
//! These are some papers that introduce the topic in a more scientific fashion than we will here.
//! That is on purpose: The documentation of this library are meant to be the more informal explanation of scope graphs.

    /// To use a scope graph,

    ///
    /// * [A scope](scope)
    /// * [A scope's data](scope_data)
    /// * [Labelled edges between scopes](edges)
    ///
    /// Once you know what a scope graph is,
    /// we can start talking about running queries over them.
    /// For a query to return the desired result, we may need to
    /// specify the following properties:
    ///
    /// * [Regular Expression]()
    /// * [Completeness]()
    /// * [Data Well-Formedness]()
    /// * [Data Equivalence]()
    /// * [Label Ordering]()
